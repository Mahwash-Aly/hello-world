# hello-world
My first repository
Hi there. This is my first day at github. I don't know a thing about coding but looking forward to something interesting.
Getting the hang of it. Started off with Python. I loved this language. It's so simple and elegant. There are no cumbersome bracket rules which scare off the newbies.
After building my basic concepts about programming, I switched to Javascript.
